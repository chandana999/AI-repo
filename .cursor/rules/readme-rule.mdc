### README.md Rules

- Make READMEs dope: fun, friendly, and approachable.
- Stay technically accurate; never trade precision for vibes.
- Lead with a short TL;DR and a crisp value prop.
- Add a Quickstart with copy-paste commands that work on macOS/Windows/Linux.
- Include "Run locally" and (if relevant) "Deploy" steps; prefer Next.js + Vercel examples when applicable.
- Prefer examples over prose; show minimal working snippets.
- Keep sections scannable: short paragraphs, bullet lists, clear headings.
- Use emoji sparingly for signposts (not in code blocks, and not where tooling expects exact headings).
- Show how to configure environment variables safely; use placeholders like YOUR_API_KEY rather than real secrets.
- Add troubleshooting and common gotchas if any.
- Include license and attribution at the end.
